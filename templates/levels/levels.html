            <p>An application achieves ASVS Level 1 (or Opportunistic) if it adequately defends against application
                security
                vulnerabilities that are easy to discover, and included in the OWASP Top 10 and other similar
                checklists.
                <br>
                <br>Level 1 is the bare minimum that all applications should strive for. It is also useful as a first
                step in a multi-phase effort or when applications do not store or handle sensitive data and therefore do
                not need the more rigorous controls of Level 2 or 3. Level 1 controls can be checked either
                automatically by tools or simply manually without access to source code. We consider Level 1 the minimum
                required for all applications.
                <br>
                <br>Threats to the application will most likely be from attackers who are using simple and low effort
                techniques to identify easy-to-find and easy-to-exploit vulnerabilities. This is in contrast to a
                determined attacker who will spend focused energy to specifically target the application. If data
                processed by your application has high value, you would rarely want to stop at a Level 1 review.
                {% elif level == 2 %}
                <p>An application achieves ASVS Level 2 (or Standard) if it adequately defends against most of the risks
                    associated
                    with software today.
                    <br>
                    <br> Level 2 ensures that security controls are in place, effective, and used within the
                    application. Level 2 is typically appropriate for applications that handle significant
                    business-to-business transactions, including those that process healthcare information, implement
                    business-critical or sensitive functions, or process other sensitive assets, or industries where
                    integrity is a critical facet to protect their business, such as the game industry to thwart
                    cheaters and game hacks.
                    <br>
                    <br> Threats to Level 2 applications will typically be skilled and motivated attackers focusing on
                    specific targets
                    using tools and techniques that are highly practiced and effective at discovering and exploiting
                    weaknesses
                    within applications.</p>
                {% else %}
                <p>ASVS Level 3 is the highest level of verification within the ASVS. This level is typically reserved
                    for applications that require significant levels of security verification, such as those that may be
                    found within areas of military, health and safety, critical infrastructure, etc.

                    Organizations may require ASVS Level 3 for applications that perform critical functions, where
                    failure could significantly impact the organization's operations, and even its survivability.
                    Example guidance on the application of ASVS Level 3 is provided below. An application achieves ASVS
                    Level 3 (or Advanced) if it adequately defends against advanced application security vulnerabilities
                    and also demonstrates principles of good security design.
                    <br>
                    <br> An application at ASVS Level 3 requires more in depth analysis, architecture, coding, and
                    testing than all
                    the other levels. A secure application is modularized in a meaningful way (to facilitate e.g.
                    resiliency,
                    scalability, and most of all, layers of security), and each module (separated by network connection
                    and/or
                    physical instance) takes care of its own security responsibilities (defence in depth), that need to
                    be properly
                    documented. Responsibilities include controls for ensuring confidentiality (e.g. encryption),
                    integrity (e.g.
                    transactions, input validation), availability (e.g. handling load gracefully), authentication
                    (including
                    between systems), non-repudiation, authorization, and auditing (logging).
